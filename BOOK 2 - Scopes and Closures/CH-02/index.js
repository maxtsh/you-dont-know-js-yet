// ***** Chapter 2: Understanding Lexical Scope

// In Chapter 1, we explored how scope is determined at code compilation, a model called "lexical scope".
// Before we get to the nuts and bolts of how using lexical scope in our programs, we should make sure we have a
// good conceptual foundation for how scope works. This chapter will illustrate scope with several metaphors. The
// goal here is to think about how your program is handled by the JS engine in ways that more closely match how the
// JS engine actually works.

// Marbles, and Buckets, and Bubbles... Oh My!
// One metaphor I've found effective in understanding scope is sorting colored marbles into buckets of their matching
// color.

// Imagine you come across a pile of marbles, and notice that all the marbles are colored red, blue, or green. To sort
// all the marbles, let's drop the red ones into a red bucket, green into a green bucket, and blue into a blue bucket.
// After sorting, when you later need a green marble, you already know the green bucket is where to go to get it.
// In this metaphor, the marbles are the variables in our program. The buckets are scopes (functions and blocks),
// which we just conceptually assign individual colors for our discussion purposes. The color of each marble is thus
// determined by which color scope we find the marble originally created in.
// Let's annotate the program example from Chapter 1 with scope color labels:

// outer/global scope: RED
var students = [
  { id: 14, name: "Kyle" },
  { id: 73, name: "Suzy" },
  { id: 112, name: "Frank" },
  { id: 6, name: "Sarah" },
];

function getStudentName(studentID) {
  // function scope: BLUE
  for (let student of students) {
    // loop scope: GREEN
    if (student.id == studentID) {
      return student.name;
    }
  }
}

var nextStudent = getStudentName(73);
console.log(nextStudent);
// Suzy

// We've designated 3 scope colors with code comments: RED (outermost global scope), BLUE (scope of function
// getStudentName(..) ), and GREEN (scope of/inside the for loop). But it still may be difficult to recognize the
// boundaries of these scope buckets when looking at a code listing.

// Figure 2 tries to make the scope boundaries easier to visualize by drawing colored bubbles around each scope:
// Fig. 2: Nested Scope Bubbles
// 1. Bubble 1 (RED) encompasses the global scope, which has three identifiers/variables: students (line 1),
// getStudentName (line 8), and nextStudent (line 16).

// 2. Bubble 2 (BLUE) encompasses the scope of the function getStudentName(..) (line 8), which has just
// one identifier/variable: the parameter studentID (line 8).

// 3. Bubble 3 (GREEN) encompasses the scope of the for -loop (line 9), which has just one identifier/variable:
// student (line 9).

// Scope bubbles are determined during compilation based on where the functions / blocks of scope are written, the
// nesting inside each other, etc. Each scope bubble is entirely contained within its parent scope bubble -- a scope is
// never partially in two different outer scopes.

// Important * look for page 83 to see the figure

// Each marble (variable/identifier) is colored based on which bubble (bucket) it's declared in, not the color of the
// scope it may be accessed from (e.g., students on line 9 and studentID on line 10).

// NOTE:
// Remember we asserted in Chapter 1 that id, name, and log are all properties, not variables; in other words,
// they're not marbles in buckets, so they don't get colored based on any the rules we're discussing in this book.
// To understand how such property accesses are handled, see Book 3 Objects & Classes.

// As the JS engine processes a program (during compilation), and finds a declaration for a variable, it essentially
// asks, "which color scope (bubble, bucket) am I currently in?" The variable is designated as that same color, meaning
// it belongs to that bucket/bubble.

// The GREEN(3) bucket is wholly nested inside of the BLUE(2) bucket, and similarly the BLUE(2) bucket is wholly
// nested inside the RED(1) bucket. Scopes can nest inside each other as shown, to any depth of nesting as your
// program needs.

// References (non-declarations) to variables/identifiers can be made if their declarations are either in the current
// scope, or any scope above/outside the current scope, but never for declarations from lower/nested scopes. So an
// expression in the RED(1) bucket only has access to RED(1) marbles, not BLUE(2) or GREEN(3). An expression in the
// BLUE(2) bucket can reference either BLUE(2) or RED(1) marbles, not GREEN(3). And an expression in the GREEN(3)
// bucket has access to RED(1), BLUE(2), and GREEN(3) marbles.

// We can conceptualize the process of determining these non-declaration marble colors during runtime as a lookup.
// Since the students variable reference in the for -loop statement on line 9 is not a declaration, it has no color.
// So we ask the current BLUE(2) scope bucket if it has a marble matching that name. Since it doesn't, the lookup
// continues with the next outer/containing scope: RED(1). The RED(1) bucket has a marble of the name students ,
// so the loop-statement's students variable is determined to be a RED(1) marble.

// The if (student.id == studentID) on line 10 is similarly determined to reference a GREEN(3) marble
// named student and a BLUE(2) marble studentID .

// NOTE:
// The JS engine doesn't generally determine these marble colors during run-time; the "lookup" here is a rhetorical
// device to help you understand the concepts. During compilation, most or all variable references will be from
// already-known scope buckets, so their color is determined at that, and stored with each marble reference to
// avoid unnecessary lookups as the program runs. More on this in the next chapter.

// The key take-aways from marbles & buckets (and bubbles!):
// Variables are declared in certain scopes, which can be thought of as colored marbles in matching-color
// buckets.

// Any reference to a variable of that same name in that scope, or any deeper nested scope, will be a marble of
// that same color -- unless an intervening scope "shadows" the variable declaration; see Chapter 3 "Shadowing.
// The determination of colored buckets, and the marbles they contain, happens during compilation. This
// information is used for variable (marble color) "lookups" during code execution.

// A Conversation Among Friends
// Another useful metaphor for the process of analyzing variables and the scopes they come from is to imagine
// various conversations that go on inside the engine as code is processed and then executed. We can "listen in" on
// these conversations to get a better conceptual foundation for how scopes work.

// Let's now meet the members of the JS engine that will have conversations as they process that program:
// 1. Engine: responsible for start-to-finish compilation and execution of our JavaScript program.
// 2. Compiler: one of Engine's friends; handles all the dirty work of parsing and code-generation (see previous
// section).
// 3. Scope Manager: another friend of Engine; collects and maintains a look-up list of all the declared
// variables/identifiers, and enforces a set of rules as to how these are accessible to currently executing code.
// For you to fully understand how JavaScript works, you need to begin to think like Engine (and friends) think, ask the
// questions they ask, and answer their questions likewise.
// To explore these conversations, recall again our running program example:
var students = [
  { id: 14, name: "Kyle" },
  { id: 73, name: "Suzy" },
  { id: 112, name: "Frank" },
  { id: 6, name: "Sarah" },
];
function getStudentName(studentID) {
  for (let student of students) {
    if (student.id == studentID) {
      return student.name;
    }
  }
}
var nextStudent = getStudentName(73);
console.log(nextStudent);
// Suzy

// Let's examine how JS is going to process that program, specifically starting with the first statement. The array and
// its contents are just basic JS value literals (and thus unaffected by any scoping concerns), so our focus here will be
// on the var students = [ .. ] declaration and initialization-assignment parts.
// We typically think of that as a single statement, but that's not how our friend Engine sees it. In fact, Engine sees two
// distinct operations, one which Compiler will handle during compilation, and the other which Engine will handle
// during execution.
// The first thing Compiler will do with this program is perform lexing to break it down into tokens, which it will then
// parse into a tree (AST).

// Once Compiler gets to code-generation, there's more detail to consider than may be obvious. A reasonable
// assumption would be that Compiler will produce code for the first statement such as: "Allocate memory for a
// variable, label it students , then stick a reference to the array into that variable." But there's more to it.

// Here's how Compiler will handle that statement:
// 1. Encountering var students , Compiler will ask Scope Manager to see if a variable named students
// already exists for that particular scope bucket. If so, Compiler would ignore this declaration and move on.
// Otherwise, Compiler will produce code that (at execution time) asks Scope Manager to create a new variable
// called students in that scope bucket.

// 2. Compiler then produces code for Engine to later execute, to handle the students = [] assignment. The
// code Engine runs will first ask Scope Manager if there is a variable called students accessible in the
// current scope bucket. If not, Engine keeps looking elsewhere (see "Nested Scope" below). Once Engine finds
// a variable, it assigns the reference of the [ .. ] array to it.

// In conversational form, the first-phase of compilation for the program might play out between Compiler and Scope
// Manager like this:

// Compiler: Hey Scope Manager (of the global scope), I found a formal declaration for an identifier called
// students , ever heard of it?
// (Global) Scope Manager: Nope, haven't heard of it, so I've just now created it for you.
// Compiler: Hey Scope Manager, I found a formal declaration for an identifier called getStudentName , ever
// heard of it?
// (Global) Scope Manager: Nope, but I just created it for you.
// Compiler: Hey Scope Manager, getStudentName points to a function, so we need a new scope bucket.
// (Function) Scope Manager: Got it, here it is.

// Compiler: Hey Scope Manager (of the function), I found a formal parameter declaration for studentID , ever
// heard of it?
// (Function) Scope Manager: Nope, but now it's registered in this scope.
// Compiler: Hey Scope Manager (of the function), I found a for -loop that will need its own scope bucket.
// ...
// The conversation is a question-and-answer exchange, where Compiler asks the current Scope Manager if an
// encountered identifier declaration has already been encountered? If "no", Scope Manager creates that variable in
// that scope. If the answer were "yes", then it would effectively be skipped over since there's nothing more for that
// Scope Manager to do.

// Compiler also signals when it runs across functions or block scopes, so that a new scope bucket and Scope
// Manager can be instantiated.

// Later, when it comes to execution of the program, the conversation will proceed between Engine and Scope
// Manager, and might play out like this:

// Engine: Hey Scope Manager (of the global scope), before we begin, can you lookup the identifier
// getStudentName so I can assign this function to it?
// (Global) Scope Manager: Yep, here you go.
// Engine: Hey Scope Manager, I found a target reference for students , ever heard of it?
// (Global) Scope Manager: Yes, it was formally declared for this scope, and it's already been initialized to
// undefined , so it's ready to assign to. Here you go.
// Engine: Hey Scope Manager (of the global scope), I found a target reference for nextStudent , ever heard of
// it?

// (Global) Scope Manager: Yes, it was formally declared for this scope, and it's already been initialized to
// undefined , so it's ready to assign to. Here you go.
// Engine: Hey Scope Manager (of the global scope), I found a source reference for getStudentName , ever
// heard of it?

// (Global) Scope Manager: Yes, it was formally declared for this scope. Here you go.
// Engine: Great, the value in getStudentName is a function, so I'm going to execute it.
// Engine: Hey Scope Manager, now we need to instantiate the function's scope.
// ...

// This conversation is another question-and-answer exchange, where Engine first asks the current Scope Manager to
// lookup the hoisted getStudentName identifier, so as to associate the function with it. Engine then proceeds to
// ask Scope Manager about the target reference for students , and so on.

// To review and summarize how a statement like var students = [ .. ] is processed, in two distinct steps:

// 1. Compiler sets up the declaration of the scope variable (since it wasn't previously declared in the current
// scope).

// 2. While Engine is executing, since the declaration has an initialization assignment, Engine asks Scope Manager
// to look up the variable, and assigns to it once found.

//
// ***** Nested Scope
// When it comes time to execute the getStudentName() function, Engine asks for a Scope Manager instance for
// that function's scope, and it will then proceed to lookup the parameter ( studentID ) to assign the 73 argument
// value to, and so on.

// The function scope for getStudentName(..) is nested inside the global scope. The block scope of the for -
// loop is similarly nested inside that function scope. Scopes can be lexically nested to any arbitrary depth as the
// program defines.

// Each scope gets its own Scope Manager instance each time that scope is executed (one or more times). Each
// scope automatically has all its identifiers registered (this is called "variable hoisting"; see Chapter 3).
// At the beginning of a scope, if any identifier came from a function declaration, that variable is automatically
// initialized to its associated function reference. And if any identifier came from a var declaration (as opposed to
// let / const ), that variable is automatically initialized to undefined so that it can be used; otherwise, the
// variable remains uninitialized (aka, in its "TDZ", see Chapter 3) and cannot be used until its declaration-andinitialization
// are executed.

// In the for (let student of students) { statement, students is a source reference that must be looked
// up. But how will that lookup be handled, since the scope of the function will not find such an identifier.
// To understand that, let's imagine that bit of conversation playing out like this:
// Engine: Hey Scope Manager (for the function), I have a source reference for students , ever heard of it?
// (Function) Scope Manager: Nope, never heard of it. Try the next outer scope.

// Engine: Hey Scope Manager (for the global scope), I have a source reference for students , ever heard of it?
// (Global) Scope Manager: Yep, it was formally declared, here you go.
// ...
// One of the most important aspects of lexical scope is that any time an identifier reference cannot be found in the
// current scope, the next outer scope in the nesting is consulted; that process is repeated until an answer is found or
// there are no more scopes to consult.

function gamer(names) {
  for (let name of names) {
    // console.log(shit);// not defined reference error or lets say not declared reference error
  }
}

gamer("COH2");

// *************** In the above example, the JS engine asks the scope manager of the for--loop to check if there is any declaration of variable "shit"
// the scope manage says there is nothing so look up in the outer scope then JS engine asks same from gamer function but still answer is no
// after that JS engine will look at the global scope manager and there is still no declaration for "shit" so it will throw and error
// saying a reference error occured.

// ********Lookup Failures
// When Engine exhausts all lexically available scopes and still cannot resolve the lookup of an identifier, an error
// condition then exists. However, depending on the mode of the program (strict-mode or not) and the role of the
// variable (i.e., target vs. source; see Chapter 1), this error condition will be handled differently.

// If the variable is a source, an unresolved identifier lookup is considered an undeclared (unknown, missing) variable,
// which results in a ReferenceError being thrown. Also, if the variable is a target, and the code at that point is
// running in strict-mode, the variable is considered undeclared and throws a ReferenceError .

// ************* WARNING:
// The error message for an undeclared variable condition, in most JS environments, will likely say, "Reference
// Error: XYZ is not defined". The phrase "not defined" seems almost identical to the term "undefined", as far as
// the English language goes. But these two are very different in JS, and this error message unfortunately creates
// a likely confusion. "Not defined" really means "not declared", or rather "undeclared", as in a variable that was
// never formally declared in any lexically available scope. By contrast, "undefined" means a variable was found
// (declared), but the variable otherwise has no value in it at the moment, so it defaults to the undefined value.
// Yes, this terminology mess is confusing and terribly unfortunate.

// However, if the variable is a target and strict-mode is not in effect, a confusing and surprising legacy behavior
// occurs. The extremely unfortunate outcome is that the global scope's Scope Manager will just create an accidental
// global variable to fulfill that target assignment!

function getStudentName3() {
  // assignment to an undeclared variable :(
  nextStudent3 = "Suzy";
}
getStudentName3();
console.log(nextStudent3);
// "Suzy" -- oops, an accidental-global variable!

// Engine: Hey Scope Manager (for the function), I have a target reference for nextStudent , ever heard of it?
// (Function) Scope Manager: Nope, never heard of it. Try the next outer scope.

// Engine: Hey Scope Manager (for the global scope), I have a target reference for nextStudent , ever heard of
// it?

// (Global) Scope Manager: Nope, but since we're in non-strict mode, I helped you out and just created a global
// variable for you, here you go.

// Yuck.

// This sort of accident (almost certain to lead to bugs eventually) is a great example of the protections of strictmode,
// and why it's such a bad idea not to use it. In strict-mode, the Global Scope Manager would instead have

// responded:
// (Global) Scope Manager: Nope, never heard of it. Sorry, but I've got to throw a ReferenceError .
// Never rely on accidental global variables. Always use strict-mode, and always formally declare your variables. You'll
// then get a helpful ReferenceError if you ever mistakenly try to assign to a not-declared variable.

// **** Building On Metaphors
// To visualize nested scope resolution, yet another useful metaphor may be an office building, such as Figure 3:
// Go to page 89 for the Figure

// The building represents our program's nested scope rule set. The first floor of the building represents the currently
// executing scope. The top level of the building is the global scope.

// You resolve a target or source variable reference by first looking on the current floor, and if you don't find it, taking
// the elevator to the next floor, looking there, then the next, and so on. Once you get to the top floor (the global
// scope), you either find what you're looking for, or you don't. But you have to stop regardless.

// Continue The Conversation
// By this point, hopefully you feel more solid with what scope is and how the JS engine determines it while compiling
// your code.

// Before continuing, go find some code in one of your projects and run through the conversations. If you find yourself
// confused or tripped up, spend time reviewing this material.

// As we move forward, we want to look in much more detail at how we use lexical scope in our programs.
