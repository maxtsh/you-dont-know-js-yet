// ********************* Chapter 4: Block Scope ======================================================================
// If you made it this far, through that long Chapter 3, you're likely feeling a lot more aware of, and hopefully more
// comfortable with, the breadth and depth of scopes and their impact on your code.
// Now, we want to focus on one specific form of scope: block scope. Just as we're narrowing our discussion focus in
// this chapter, so too is block scope about narrowing the focus of a larger scope down to a smaller subset of our
// program.

// // ****** Least Exposure
// It makes sense that functions define their own scopes. But why do we need blocks to create scopes as well?
// Software engineering articulates a fundamental pattern, typically applied to software security, called "The Principle
// of Least Privilege" (POLP, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege). And a variation of this
// principle that applies to our current discussion is typically labeled "Least Exposure".

// POLP expresses a defensive posture to software architecture: components of the system should be designed to
// function with least privilege, least access, least exposure. If each piece is connected with minimum-necessary
// capabilities, the overall system is stronger from a security standpoint, because a compromise or failure of one
// piece has a minimized impact on the rest of the system.

// If POLP focuses on system-level component design, the Exposure variant (POLE) can be focused on a lower level;
// we'll apply it to our exploration of how scopes interact with each other.

// In following POLE, what do we want to minimize the exposure of? The variables registered in each scope.
// Think of it this way: why wouldn't you just place all the variables of your program out in the global scope? That
// probably immediately feels like a bad idea, but it's worth considering why that is. When variables used by one part
// of the program are exposed to another part of the program, via scope, there are 3 main hazards that can arise:
// 1. Naming Collisions: if you use a common and useful variable/function name in two different parts of the
// program, but the identifier comes from one shared scope (like the global scope), then name collision occurs,
// and it's very likely that bugs will occur as one part uses the variable/function in a way the other part doesn't
// expect. For example, imagine if all your loops used a single global i index variable, and then it happened
// that one loop in a function was run during an iteration of a loop from another function, and now the shared
// i variable has an unexpected value.

// 2. Unexpected Behavior: if you expose variables/functions whose usage is otherwise private to a piece of the
// program, it allows other developers to use them in ways you didn't intend, which can violate expected
// behavior and cause bugs. For example, if your part of the program assumes an array contains all numbers,
// but someone else's code accesses and modifies the array to include booleans or strings, your code may then
// misbehave in unexpected ways.

// Worse, exposure of private details invites those with mal-intent to try to work around limitations you have
// imposed, to do things with your part of the software that shouldn't be allowed.

// 3. Unintended Dependency: if you expose variables/functions unnecessarily, it invites other developers to use
// and depend on those otherwise private pieces. While that doesn't break your program today, it creates a
// refactoring hazard in the future, because now you cannot as easily refactor that variable or function without
// potentially breaking other parts of the software that you don't control. For example, If your code relies on an
// array of numbers, and you later decide it's better to use some other data structure instead of an array, you
// now must take on the liability of fixing other affected parts of the software.

// POLE, as applied to variable/function scoping, essentially says, default to exposing the bare minimum necessary,
// keeping everything else as private as possible. Declare variables in as small and deeply nested of scopes as
// possible, rather than placing everything in the global (or even outer function) scope.
// If you design your software accordingly, you have a much greater chance of avoiding (or at least minimizing) these
// 3 hazards.

function diff(x, y) {
  if (x > y) {
    let tmp = x;
    x = y;
    y = tmp;
  }
  return y - x;
}
console.log(diff(3, 7)); // 4
console.log(diff(7, 5)); // 2

// In this diff(..) function, we want to ensure that y is greater than or equal to x , so that when we subtract ( y
//     - x ), the result is 0 or larger. If x is larger, we swap x and y using a tmp variable.
//     In this simple example, it doesn't seem to matter whether tmp is inside the if block or whether it belongs at the
//     function level -- but it certainly shouldn't be a global variable! However, following the POLE principle, tmp should
//     be as hidden in scope as possible. So we block scope tmp (using let ) to the if block.

// ******** Hiding In Plain (Function) Scope

// It should now be clear why it's important to hide our variable and function declarations in the lowest (most deeply
// nested) scopes possible. But how do we do so?
// You've already seen let (and const ) declarations, which are block scoped declarators, and we'll come back to
// them in more detail shortly. But what about hiding var or function declarations in scopes? That can easily be
// done by wrapping a function scope around a declaration.

// Let's consider an example where function scoping can be useful.
// The mathematical operation "factorial" (notated as "6!") is the multiplication of a given integer against all
// successively lower integers down to 1 -- actually, you can stop at 2 since multiplying 1 does nothing. In other
// words, "6!" is the same as "6 * 5!", which is the same as "6 * 5 * 4!", and so on. Because of the nature of the math
// involved, once any given integer's factorial (like "4!") has been calculated, we shouldn't need to do that work again,
// as it'll always be the same answer.

// So if you naively calculate factorial for 6 , then later want to calculate factorial for 7 , you might unnecessarily recalculate
// the factorials of all the integers from 1 up to 6. If you're willing to trade memory for speed, you can solve
// that wasted computation by caching each integer's factorial as it's calculated:

var cache = {};
function factorial(x) {
  if (x < 2) return 1;
  if (!(x in cache)) {
    cache[x] = x * factorial(x - 1);
  }
  return cache[x];
}
console.log(factorial(6));
// 720
console.log(cache);
// {
// "2": 2,
// "3": 6,
// "4": 24,
// "5": 120,
// "6": 720
// }
console.log(factorial(7));
// 5040
console.log(cache);

// We're storing all the computed factorials in cache so that across multiple calls to factorial(..) , the answers
// remain. But the cache variable is pretty obviously a private detail of how factorial(..) works, not something
// that should be exposed in an outer scope -- especially not the global scope.

// However, fixing this over-exposure issue is not as simple as hiding the cache variable inside factorial(..) ,
// as it might seem. Since we need cache to survive multiple calls, it must be located in a scope outside that
// function. So what can we do?

// Define another middle scope (between the outer/global scope and the inside of factorial(..) ) for cache to
// live in:

// outer/global scope
function hideTheCache() {
  // "middle scope", where we hide `cache`
  var cache = {};
  function factorial(x) {
    // inner scope
    if (x < 2) return 1;
    if (!(x in cache)) {
      cache[x] = x * factorial(x - 1);
    }
    return cache[x];
  }
  return factorial;
}
var factorial = hideTheCache();
console.log(factorial(6));
// 720
console.log(factorial(7));
// 5040

// The hideTheCache() function serves no other purpose than to create a scope for cache to persist in across
// multiple calls to factorial(..) . But for factorial(..) to have access to cache , we have to define
// factorial(..) inside that same scope. Then we return the function reference, as a value from
// hideTheCache() , and store it back in an outer scope variable, also named factorial . Now we can call
// factorial(..) (multiple times!); its persistent cache stays hidden but accessible only to factorial(..) !

// OK, but... it's going to be tedious to define (and name!) a hideTheCache(..) function scope each time such a
// need for variable/function hiding occurs, especially since we'll likely want to avoid name collisions with this function
// by giving each occurrence a unique name. Ugh.

// NOTE:
// The illustrated technique -- caching a function's computed output to optimize performance when repeated
// calls of the same inputs are expected -- is quite common in the Functional Programming (FP) world,
// canonically referred to as "memoization". FP libraries will provide a utility for memoization of functions, which
// would take the place of hideTheCache(..) above. Memoization is beyond the scope (pun intended!) of our
// discussion. See my "Functional-Light JavaScript" book for more information.

// Rather than defining a new and uniquely named function each time one of those scope-only-for-the-purpose-ofhiding-
// a-variable situations occurs, a perhaps better solution is to use a function expression:

var factorial = (function hideTheCache() {
  var cache = {};
  function factorial(x) {
    if (x < 2) return 1;
    if (!(x in cache)) {
      cache[x] = x * factorial(x - 1);
    }
    return cache[x];
  }
  return factorial;
})();
factorial(6);
// 720
factorial(7);
// 5040

// Wait! This is still using a function to create the scope for hiding cache , and in this case, the function is still
// named hideTheCache , so how does that solve anything?

// Recall from "Function Name Scope" (Chapter 3), what happens to the name identifier from a function expression.
// Since hideTheCache(..) is defined as a function expression instead of a function declaration, its name
// is in its own scope -- essentially the same scope as cache -- rather than in the outer/global scope.

// That means we could name every single occurrence of such a function expression the exact same name, and never
// have any collision. More appropriately, we could name each occurrence semantically based on whatever it is we're
// trying to hide, and not worry that whatever name we choose is going to collide with any other function
// expression scope in the program.

// In fact, as we discussed in "Function Name Scope" (Chapter 3), we could just leave off the name entirely -- thus
// defining an "anonymous function expression" instead. Appendix A will explore the importance of names for
// such functions.

// ******* Important

// ****** Invoking Function Expressions Immediately
// But there's another important bit in the above program that's easy to miss: the line at the end of the function
// expression that contains })(); .

// Notice that we surrounded the entire function expression in a set of ( .. ) , and then on the end, we added
// that second () parentheses set; that's actually calling the function expression we just defined. Moreover, in
// this case, the first set of surrounding ( .. ) around the function expression is not strictly necessary (more on
// that in a moment), but we used them for readability sake anyway.

// So, in other words, we're defining a function expression that's then immediately invoked. This common pattern
// has a (very creative!) name: Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE).

// IIFEs are useful when we want to create a scope to hide variables/functions. Since they are expressions, they can
// be used in any place in a JS program where an expression is allowed. IIFEs can be named, as with
// hideTheCache() , or (much more commonly!) unnamed/anonymous. And they can be standalone or, as above,
// part of another statement -- hideTheCache() returns the factorial() function reference which is then =
// assigned to a variable factorial .

// For comparison, here's an example of a standalone (anonymous) IIFE:

// outer scope
(function () {
  // inner hidden scope
})();
// more outer scope

// Unlike earlier with hideTheCache() , where the outer surrounding (..) were noted as being an optional
// stylistic choice, for standalone IIFEs, they're required, to distinguish the function as an expression and not a
// statement. So for consistency, it's best to always surround IIFE function s with ( .. ) .

// NOTE:
// Technically, the surrounding ( .. ) aren't the only syntactic way to ensure a function in an IIFE is treated by
// the JS parser as a function expression. We'll look at some other options in Appendix A.

// ******** Function Boundaries
// Be aware that using an IIFE to define a scope can have some unintended consequences, depending on the code
// around it. Because an IIFE is a full function, the function boundary alters the behavior of certain
// statements/constructs.

// For example, a return statement in some piece of code would change its meaning if then wrapped in an IIFE,
// because now the return would refer to the IIFE's function. Non-arrow function IIFEs also change the binding of a
// this keyword. And statements like break and continue won't operate across an IIFE function boundary to
// control an outer loop or block.

// So, if the code you need to wrap a scope around has return , this , break , or continue in it, an IIFE is
// probably not the best approach. In that case, you might look to create the scope with a block instead of a function.

// ***** Very important

// ******Scoping With Blocks
// You should by this point feel fairly comfortable with creating scopes to prevent unnecessary identifier exposure.
// And so far, we looked at doing this via function (i.e., IIFE) scope. But let's now consider using let
// declarations with nested blocks. In general, any { .. } curly-brace pair which is a statement will act as a block,
// but not necessarily as a scope. A block only becomes a scope if it needs to, to contain any block-scoped
// declarations (i.e., let or const ) present within it.
// Consider:
{
  let thisIsNowAScope = true;
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // this is also a scope, activated each iteration
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
      // this is just a block, not a scope
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
}
// 0 2 4

// ***** Very important

// NOTE:
// Not all { .. } curly-brace pairs create blocks (and thus are eligible to become scopes). Object literals use { ..
// } curly-brace pairs to delimit their key-value lists, but such objects are not scopes. class uses { .. } curlybraces
// around its body definition, but this is not a block or scope. A function uses { .. } around its body, but
// this is not technically a block -- it's a single statement for the function body -- though it is a (function) scope.
// The { .. } curly-brace pair around the case clauses of a switch statement does not define a block/scope.

// Blocks can be defined as part of a statement (like an if or for ), or as bare standalone block statements, as
// shown in the outermost { .. } curly brace pair in the snippet above. An explicit block of this sort, without any
// declarations (and thus, not actually a scope) serves no operational purpose, though it can be useful as a stylistic
// signal.

// Explicit blocks were always valid JS syntax, but since they couldn't be a scope, they were extremely uncommon
// prior to ES6's introduction of let / const . Now they're starting to catch on a little bit.

// In most languages that support block scoping, an explicit block scope is a very common pattern for creating a
// narrow slice of scope for one or a few variables. So following the POLE principle, we should embrace this pattern
// more widespread in JS as well; use block scoping to narrow the exposure of identifiers to the minimum practical.
// An explicit block scope can be useful even inside of another block (whether it's a scope or not).

// For example:
const somethingHappened = {
  message: function () {
    console.log("Something");
  },
};

if (somethingHappened) {
  // this is a block, but not a scope
  {
    // this is an explicit block scope
    let msg = somethingHappened.message();
    // notifyOthers(msg);
  }
  //   recoverFromSomething();
}

// Here, the { .. } curly-brace pair inside the if statement is an even smaller inner explicit block scope for msg ,
// since that variable is not needed for the entire if block. Most developers would just block-scope msg to the if
// block and move on. When there's only a few lines to consider, it's a toss-up judgement call. As code grows, these
// issues become more pronounced.

// So does it matter enough to add the extra { .. } pair and indentation level? I think you should follow POLE and
// always define the smallest block (within reason!) for each variable. So I would recommend using the extra explicit
// block scope.

// WARNING:
// Recall the discussion of TDZ errors from "Uninitialized" (Chapter 3). My suggestion to minimize the risk of TDZ
// errors with let (or const) declarations is to always put the declarations at the top of any scope. If you find
// yourself putting a let declaration in the middle of a scope block, first think, "Oh, no! TDZ alert!". Then recognize
// that if this let declaration isn't actually needed for the whole block, you could/should use an inner explicit
// block scope to further narrow its exposure!

// Another example making use of an explicit block scope:

function getNextMonthStart(dateStr) {
  var nextMonth, year;
  {
    let curMonth;
    [, year, curMonth] = dateStr.match(/(\d{4})-(\d{2})-\d{2}/) || [];
    nextMonth = (Number(curMonth) % 12) + 1;
  }
  // did we cross a year boundary?
  if (nextMonth == 1) {
    year++;
  }
  return `${year}-${String(nextMonth).padStart(2, "0")}-01`;
}
getNextMonthStart("2019-12-25");
// 2020-01-01

// Let's first identify the scopes and their identifiers:
// 1. The outer/global scope has one identifier, the function getNextMonthStart(..) .
// 2. The function scope for getNextMonthStart(..) has three identifiers: dateStr (the parameter),
// nextMonth , and year .

// 3. The { .. } curly-brace pair defines an inner block scope that includes one variable: curMonth .
// So why did we put curMonth in an explicit block scope instead of just alongside nextMonth and year in the
// top-level function scope? Because curMonth is only needed for those first two statements. Exposing it at the
// function scope level is, in essence, over-exposing it.

// This example is small, so the hazards are pretty minimal in over-exposing the scoping of curMonth . But the
// benefits of the POLE principle are best achieved when you adopt the mindset of minimizing scope exposure as a
// habit. If you follow the principle consistently even in the small cases, it will serve you more as your programs grow.

// Let's now look at an even more substantial example:

function sortNamesByLength(names) {
  var buckets = [];
  for (let firstName of names) {
    if (buckets[firstName.length] == null) {
      buckets[firstName.length] = [];
    }
    buckets[firstName.length].push(firstName);
  }
  // a block to narrow the scope
  {
    let sortedNames = [];
    for (let bucket of buckets) {
      if (bucket) {
        // sort each bucket alphanumerically
        bucket.sort();
        // append the sorted names to our running list
        sortedNames = [...sortedNames, ...bucket];
      }
    }
    return sortedNames;
  }
}
console.log(
  sortNamesByLength([
    "Max",
    "Sally",
    "Suzy",
    "Frank",
    "John",
    "Jennifer",
    "Scott",
  ])
);
// [ "Max", "John", "Suzy", "Frank", "Sally", "Scott", "Jennifer" ]

// There are six identifiers declared across five different scopes. Could all of these variables have existed in the single
// outer/global scope? Technically, yes, since they're all uniquely named and thus have no name collisions. But this
// would be really poor code organization, and would likely lead to both confusion and future bugs.

// We split them out into each inner nested scope as appropriate. Each variable is defined at the innermost scope
// possible for the program to operate as desired.

// sortedNames could have been defined in the top-level function scope, but it's only needed for the second half of
// this function. To avoid over-exposing that variable in a higher level scope, we again follow POLE and block-scope it
// in the inner block scope.

<<<<<<< HEAD
// ********** Very important note:

// In these two loops

// console.log(window.i); // undefined // we call for global var declared i before it gets formally initialized to its undefined

for (var i = 0; i <= 6; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
}

// console.log(window.i); // 7 // we call for global var declared i after the loop so it contains number 7 end result of loop

// Prints out the number 7 for seven times!

for (let i = 0; i <= 6; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
}

// Prints out numbers between 0 to 6 each of them one time

// I think the reason is because of difference between var and let:
// var attaches itself to the global object if its declared in a block scope or to the top of a function scope if declared in a function
// unlike let that is not global scope and stays in the block scope so:
// on the first loop with var, each time the loop runs var is not re-declared otherwise is re-assigend to next i value as i gets ++
// so at the begining before 1000 ms the loop is over and each re-assign is done and last value gets printed 7 times
// But in the second loop because let i is re-declared each time the loop goes on, then each scope with respect to each loop runtime prints the proportional i value to its loop so evrything works fine there and each number gets printed out.
=======
// ******** var AND let

// Next, let's talk about the declaration var buckets . That variable is used across the entire function (except the
// final return statement). Any variable that is needed across all (or even most) of a function should be declared so
// that such usage is obvious.
// NOTE:
// The parameter names isn't used across the whole function, but there's no way limit the scope of a parameter, so
// it behaves as a function-wide declaration regardless.
// So why did we use var instead of let to declare the buckets variable? There's both stylistic and technical
// reasons to choose var here.
// Stylistically, var has always, from the earliest days of JS, signaled "variable that belongs to a whole function". As
// we asserted in "Lexical Scope" (Chapter 1), var attaches to the nearest enclosing function scope, no matter
// where it appears. That's true even if var appears inside a block:

function diff(x, y) {
  if (x > y) {
    var tmp = x; // `tmp` is function-scoped
    x = y;
    y = tmp;
  }
  return y - x;
}

// Even though var is inside a block, its declaration is function-scoped (to diff(..) ), not block-scoped.
// While you can declare var inside a block (and still have it be function-scoped), I would recommend you minimize
// this approach except in a few specific cases (discussed in Appendix A). Otherwise, var should be reserved for
// use in the top-level scope of a function.

// Why not just use let in that same location? Because var is visually distinct from let and therefore signals
// clearly, "this variable is function-scoped". Using let in the top-level scope, especially if not in the first few lines of
// a function, especially when all the other declarations in blocks use let , does not visually draw attention to the
// difference with the function-scoped declaration.

// In other words, I feel var better communicates function-scoped than let does, and let both communicates
// (and achieves!) block-scoping where var is insufficient. As long as your programs are going to need both
// function-scoped and block-scoped variables, the most sensible and readable approach is to use both var AND
// let together, each for their own best purpose.

// There are other stylistic and operational reasons to choose var or let in different scenarios. We'll explore the
// case for var alongside let in more detail in Appendix A.

// WARNING:
// My advice to use var AND let here is controversial. It's far more common to hear assertions like, "var is
// broken, let fixes it" and, "never use var, let is the replacement". Those opinions are as valid as my opinions, but
// they're just opinions; var is not factually broken or deprecated. It has worked since early JS and it will continue
// to always work as long as JS is around.

// When To let ?
// My advice to reserve var for (mostly only) a top-level function scope means that all other declarations should use
// let . But you may still be wondering how to decide where each declaration in your program belongs?
// POLE already guides you on those decisions, but let's make sure we explicitly state it. The way to decide is not
// based on which keyword you want to use. The way to decide is to ask, "What is the most minimal scope exposure
// that's sufficient for this variable?" Once that is answered, you'll know if a variable belongs in a block scope or the
// function scope. If you decide initially that a variable should be block-scoped, and later realize it needs to be
// elevated to be function-scoped, then that dictates a change not only in the location of that variable's declaration,
// but also the keyword used. The decision making process really should proceed like that
// If a declaration belongs in a block scope, use let . If it belongs in the function scope, use var (again, my
// opinion).

// But another way to sort of visualize this decision making is to consider the pre-ES6 version of a program. For
// example, let's recall diff(..) from earlier:

function diff(x, y) {
  var tmp;
  if (x > y) {
    tmp = x;
    x = y;
    y = tmp;
  }
  return y - x;
}

// In this version of diff(..) , tmp is clearly declared in the function scope. Is that appropriate for tmp ? I would
// argue, no. tmp is only needed for those few statements. It's not needed once we get to the return statement. It
// should therefore be block-scoped.
// Prior to ES6, we didn't have let so we couldn't actually block-scope it. But we could do the next-best thing:
function diff(x, y) {
  if (x > y) {
    // `tmp` is still function-scoped, but
    // it signals block-scoping stylistically
    var tmp = x;
    x = y;
    y = tmp;
  }
  return y - x;
}

// Placing the var declaration for tmp inside the if statement signals to the reader of the code that tmp
// belongs to that block. Even though JS doesn't enforce that scoping, the stylistic signal still has benefit for the
// reader of your code.

// Now, you can just locate any var that's inside a block of this sort and switch it to let to enforce the signal
// already being sent stylistically.

// Another example that used to be commonly based on var but which should pretty much always be let is a
// for loop:

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // do something
}
// No matter where such a loop is defined, the i should basically always be used only inside the loop, in which case
// POLE tells us it should be declared with let instead of var :

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // do something
}
// Basically the only time switching a var to a let in this way would "break" your code is if you were relying on
// accessing the loop's iterator ( i ) outside/after the loop, such as:

// for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
//   if (checkValue(i)) {
//     break;
//   }
// }
// if (i < 5) {
//   console.log("The loop stopped early!");
// }

// This usage pattern is not terribly uncommon, but most feel it signals poor code structure. A better approach is to
// introduce another outer-scoped variable:

// var lastI;
// for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
//   lastI = i;
//   if (checkValue(i)) {
//     break;
//   }
// }
// if (lastI < 5) {
//   console.log("The loop stopped early!");
// }

// lastI is needed across this whole scope (function or global), so it's declared with var . i is only needed in
// (each) loop iteration, so it's declared with let .
// What's The Catch?

// So far we've asserted that var and parameters are function-scoped, and let / const signal block-scoped
// declarations. There's one little exception to call out: the catch clause.
// Since the introduction of try..catch way back in ES3, the catch clause has held an additional (little-known)
// block-scoping declaration capability:

// try {
//   doesntExist();
// } catch (err) {
//   console.log(err);
//   // ReferenceError: 'doesntExist' is not defined
//   // ^^^^ this is printed from the caught exception
//   let onlyHere = true;
//   var outerVariable = true;
// }
// console.log(outerVariable); // true
// console.log(err);

// ReferenceError: 'err' is not defined
// ^^^^ this is another thrown (uncaught) exception

// The err variable declared by the catch clause is block-scoped to that block. This clause block can have other
// block-scoped declarations via let . But a var declaration inside this block still attaches to the outer
// function/global scope.

// ES2019 (recently, at the time of writing) changed catch clauses so their declaration is optional. If you need to
// catch that an exception occurred (so you can gracefully recover), but you don't care about the error value itself, you
// can omit that declaration:

// try {
//   doOptionOne();
// } catch {
//   // catch-declaration omitted
//   doOptionTwoInstead();
// }

// NOTE:
// In this case, the catch block is not a scope unless a let declaration is added inside it.
// This is a small but delightful simplification of syntax for a fairly common use-case!
// Functions Declarations In Blocks (FiB)
// We've seen now that let / const declarations are block-scoped, and var declarations are function-scoped.
// So what about function declarations that appear directly inside blocks (as a feature, called "FiB")?
// We typically think of function declarations like they're the equivalent of a var declaration. So are they
// function-scoped?

// No, and yes. I know... that's confusing. Let's dig in.
// Consider:

if (false) {
  function ask() {
    console.log("Does this run?");
  }
}
ask();

// What do you expect for this program to do? Three reasonable outcomes:

// 1. The ask() call might fail with a Reference Error exception, because the ask identifier is block-scoped to
// the if block scope and thus isn't available in the outer/global scope.

// 2. The ask() call might fail with a Type Error exception, because the ask identifier exists, but it's
// undefined (since the if statement doesn't run) and thus not a callable function.

// 3. The ask() call might run correctly, printing out the "Does it run?" message.

// Here's the confusing part: depending on which JS environment you try that code snippet in, you may get different
// results! This is one of those few crazy areas where existing legacy behavior interferes with getting a predictable
// outcome.

// The JS specification says that function declarations inside of blocks are block-scoped, so the answer should be
// (1). However, most browser-based JS engines (including v8 which comes from Chrome but is also used in Node)
// will behave as (2), meaning the identifier is scoped outside the if block but the function value is not
// automatically initialized, so it remains undefined .

// Why are browser JS engines allowed to behave contrary to the specification? Because these engines already had
// certain behaviors around FiB before ES6 introduced block scoping, and there was concern that changing to adhere
// to the specification might break some existing website JS code. As such, an exception was made in Appendix B of
// the specification, which allows certain deviations for browser JS engines (only!).

// NOTE:
// You wouldn't typically categorize Node as being a browser JS environment, since it usually runs on a server.
// But it's an interesting corner case since it shares the v8 engine with the Chrome (and Edge, now) browsers.
// Since v8 is first a browser JS engine, it follows this Appendix B exception, which then means that the browser
// exceptions are extended to Node.

// One of the most common use-cases for placing a function declaration in a block is to conditionally define a
// function one way or another (like with an if..else statement) depending on some environment state. For
// example:

if (typeof Array.isArray != "undefined") {
  function isArray(a) {
    return Array.isArray(a);
  }
} else {
  function isArray(a) {
    return Object.prototype.toString.call(a) == "[object Array]";
  }
}

// It's tempting to structure code this way for performance reasons, since the typeof Array.isArray check is
// only performed once, as opposed to defining just one isArray(..) and putting the if statement inside it,
// where the check then runs unnecessarily on every call.

// WARNING:
// In addition to the risks of FiB deviations, one problem with the conditional-definition of functions is that it is
// harder to debug such a program. If you end up with a bug in the isArray(..) function, you first have to figure
// out which isArray(..) function definition is actually applied! Sometimes, the bug is that the wrong one got
// applied because the conditional check was incorrect! If you allow a program to define multiple versions of a
// function, that program is always harder to reason about and maintain.
// In addition to the situations in the above snippets, there are several other corner cases around FiB you can be bitten
// by; such behaviors in various browsers and non-browser JS environments (that is, JS engines that aren't primarily
// browser based) will likely vary.
// For example:

if (true) {
  function ask() {
    console.log("Am I called?");
  }
}
if (true) {
  function ask() {
    console.log("Or what about me?");
  }
}
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  function ask() {
    console.log("Or is it one of these?");
  }
}
ask();
function ask() {
  console.log("Maybe, it's this one?");
}

// ****** important

// Recall that function hoisting as described in "When Can I Use A Variable?" (Chapter 3) might suggest that the final
// ask() in this snippet, with "Maybe..." as its message, would hoist above the call to ask() . Since it's the last
// function declaration of that name, it should "win", right? Unfortunately, no.

// It's not my intention to document all these weird corner cases, nor to try to explain why each of them behaves a
// certain way. That information is, in my opinion, useless legacy trivia.

// My real concern with FiB is, what advice can I give to ensure your code behaves predictably in all circumstances?
// As far as I'm concerned, the only practical answer to avoiding the vagaries of FiB is to simply avoid FiB entirely. In
// other words, never place a function declaration directly inside any block. Always place function declarations
// at the top-level scope of a function (or in the global scope).

// So for the earlier if..else example, my suggestion is to avoid conditionally defining functions if at all possible.
// Yes it may be slightly less performant, but this is a better overall option in my opinion:

function isArray(a) {
  if (typeof Array.isArray != "undefined") {
    return Array.isArray(a);
  } else {
    return Object.prototype.toString.call(a) == "[object Array]";
  }
}

// If that performance hit becomes a critical path issue for your application, I suggest you consider this approach:

var isArray = function isArray(a) {
  return Array.isArray(a);
};
// override the definition, if you must
if (typeof Array.isArray == "undefined") {
  isArray = function isArray(a) {
    return Object.prototype.toString.call(a) == "[object Array]";
  };
}

// It's important to notice that here I'm placing a function expression, not a declaration, inside the if statement.
// That's perfectly fine and valid, for function expressions to appear inside blocks. Our discussion about FiB is
// about avoiding function declarations in blocks.

// Even if you test your program and it works correctly, the small benefit you may derive from using FiB style in your
// code is far outweighed by the potential risks in the future for confusion by other developers, or variances in how
// your code runs in other JS environments.

// FiB is not worth it, and should be avoided.

// Blocked Over
// The whole point of lexical scoping rules in a programming language is so we can appropriately organize our
// program's variables, both for operational as well as stylistic code communication purposes.
// And one of the most important organizational techniques we can learn to get better at is to ensure that no variable
// is over-exposed to unnecessary scopes (POLE). Hopefully you now appreciate block scoping much more deeply
// than before.

// This whole discussion of lexical scoping so far in the book is intended to build up a solid foundation of
// understanding so we can tackle the topic of closure effectively. Before moving on to the next chapter, make sure
// you are fully comfortable with all the ins and outs of lexical scope.
